 When I moved to Houston in 1963 and complained about the humidity of South Texas summers, a grizzled native replied, "If you don't like the weather, just wait five minutes, and it will change." One can probably reasonably observe that the more unpredictable the weather, the more inclined we are to perpetuate weather lore and, at times, even to practice it.
