 The Renaissance, a spirit which had kindled the fires of learning in other countries, spread to England with its vibrant, intellectual queen to assist it rather than to contain or extinguish it. With Mary or sickly Edward and his protector and governor, Edward Seymour, the spirit of the Renaissance might never have spread to a receptive assemblage of subjects, and England might have continued its stifling asceticism and unproductive civil strife. Writers praised Elizabeth in prose, drama, and verse, and the Queen and her subjects delighted in reading the literary homage.
